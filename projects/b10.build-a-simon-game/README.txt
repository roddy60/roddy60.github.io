MANUAL TESTING

The specification
(<https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-simon-game>) says:

  User Story: I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct.

However, for manual testing, it may be convenient to play with a smaller
number than 20, say 6.  This can be done by adding "?total_steps_final=6" to
the URL.
