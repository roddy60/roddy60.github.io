As noted in js/Engine.js, this software makes no effort to find
the best move.

UNIT TESTS

This application comes with unit tests.  To run them, load the following
file into a web browser:

  tests/qunit/index.html

SASS TO CSS

If you are working on the Sass files, you will need to have the following
command running to see the effect of your changes:

  sass --watch style/tic-tac-toe/scss:generated/style/tic-tac-toe/css

It compiles Sass files to CSS.

During initial development, the version of Sass used was 3.4.25.
