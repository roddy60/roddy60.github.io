Assumptions:

  At the start of each test, the app's configuration is:

    {
      update_interval: 2e3,
      usernames: [
        'esl_sc2',
        'freecodecamp',
        'test_channel',
      ],
    }

  And the app's test configuration is:

    {
      ajax_timeout: 3e3,
      max_updates: 3,
    }

Test:

  Title: Basic

  Steps:

    * Access the app in a web browser.

    * Verify:

      * The "Last updated" time updates every 2 seconds (until updating
      stops, due to the 'max_updates' setting).

      * Each user's name is a hyperlink to a web page in the twitch.tv
      domain.

    * Uncheck the 2 checkboxes, then put them back in the checked state.
    Verify:

      * Each time you change a checkbox, the app does the right thing.

      * When both checkboxes are unchecked, the app's appearance is OK.

Test:

  Title: User order

  Steps:

    * Access the app in a web browser.

    * Verify:

      * The users are in the same order as in the configuration.

    * In the configuration, reverse the order of the 'usernames' setting.

    * Access the app in a web browser.

    * Verify:

      * The users are in the same order as in the configuration.

Test:

  Title: No access to server

  Steps:

    * Cut off the web browser's access to the API server
    (without cutting off its access to the app's static files).

    * Access the app in a web browser.

    * Verify that the browser shows a page consisting of the following:

      Twitch Streamers

          ERROR

Test:

  Title: First attempt to get streaming information fails

  Steps:

    * In the test configuration, set:

      * streaming_info_attempt_1_fails to true.

    * Access the app in a web browser.

    * Verify:

      * The app loads, then shows a page consisting of the following:

        Twitch Streamers

            ERROR

      A few seconds later, the app shows a page listing the users and what
      they are streaming, just as if there had never been a failure.
